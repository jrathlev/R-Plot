###R-Plot - Visualization of measuring data

R-Plot is a Windows program for presenting measuring data as X-Y diagrams, 
bar charts or histograms. Optionally you can add error bars, best-fit curves, 
computed functions, images, text and simple graphic objects. The number of 
charts per sheet and objects per chart are in theory unlimited.

The desktop is split into two windows: One for the graphical output and one
for for editing the plot parameters. The sheet can be sent to any Windows 
printer, inserted into another application using the clipboard and/or 
exported as Encapsulated Postscript (EPS) for insertion as an image into 
LaTeX documents.

The following objects are available:
- X and Y axes
- Data curves
- Best-fit curves
- Computed functions
- Bar charts
- Histograms
- Text boxes
- Comments
- Legends
- Results from best-fit curves
- Lines and rectangles
- Imported images
